# TemplateBot
I make a lot of Discord bots. Most of them are temporary things for mild amusement, and I've found that it takes a while to set up the initial JDA environment for a new bot. That's why I made Template Bot.

Template Bot is simply a generic template for JDA based Java Discord bots. I use it whenever I create a new bot, as it provides the basic framework and organizational structure that I've found to be the most condusive to effective bot development.

If you're a Java Discord bot developer interested in using my template, feel free to fork this repository and make your own bot. (Don't forget to update the build.gradle to include the latest JDA version). Have fun developing.
