# TemplateBot
I make a lot of Discord bots. Most of them are temporary things for mild amusement, and I've found that it takes a while to set up the initial JDA environment for a new bot. That's why I made Template Bot.

Template Bot is simply a generic template for JDA based Java Discord bots. I use it whenever I create a new bot, as it provides the basic framework and organizational structure that I've found to be the most conducive to effective bot development.

If you're a Java Discord bot developer interested in using my template, feel free to clone this repository and make your own bot. Have fun developing.

# Cloning TemplateBot
If you're looking to use TemplateBot to begin your own Discord bot, simply clone this repository and rename it. Don't forget to update the build.gradle to include the latest version of JDA (in case TemplateBot isn't updated), and make sure to change settings.gradle to reflect the new project name.
